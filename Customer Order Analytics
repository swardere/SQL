#In this SQL, We are querying a database with different tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct cust.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust 
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb 
ON cust.order_id=feb.orderID
WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'OrderID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT MIN(price), product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, sum(quantity),sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7.How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust 
ON feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE feb.Quantity>2
AND length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'OrderID';
