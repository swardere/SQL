#2.Show only the Customers from Brazil.

#8.How many Invoices were there in 2009?

JOIN chinook.invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
GROUP BY e.FirstName
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;

#14.Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.FirstName,e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) AS TotalSales
